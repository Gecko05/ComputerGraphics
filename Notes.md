## Introduction to 2D

Graphics platforms are divided into the following:
* Immediate-Mode provide lean and efficient APIs that let the developer freely manipulate the graphics hardware to draw primitives and such.
* Retained-Mode can take on many common tasks concerning the display and user interaction. It allows for faster development of UIs. They use a special purpose database called scene graph, which is modified by the API and then used by a display synchronizer to draw the actual pixels.

### Specification Techniques

* Procedural code: Use of programming languages and APIs.
* Declarative specification: Markup languages (SVG, XAML).
